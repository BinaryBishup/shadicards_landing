Build an Interactive AI Guest Management Section

  Create a section showcasing how ShadiCards' AI assistant automatically collects wedding guest information via WhatsApp. The section should demonstrate:

  Core Features to Showcase:
  - AI chatbot sending personalized wedding invitations in multiple Indian languages
  - Natural conversation flow where AI collects delivery addresses
  - RSVP management and guest preferences
  - Automated follow-ups and reminders

  User Interaction Flow:
  - User enters their WhatsApp number to see a live demo
  - Real-time chat simulation shows AI conversing with a guest
  - Guest shares location, AI confirms address and delivery details
  - Show how different guests receive different messages based on their relationship (bride's side/groom's side)

  Visual Requirements:
  - Split layout: CTA and controls on left, WhatsApp interface mockup on right
  - Authentic WhatsApp UI with proper message bubbles, timestamps, read receipts
  - Smooth message animations appearing sequentially
  - Typing indicators between messages

  Quick Settings:
  - Language selector (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi with native scripts)
  - Template themes (Traditional, Modern, Royal, Floral)
  - Religion-based customization options
  - These settings should instantly update the demo conversation

  Technical Requirements:
  - Use shadcn/ui components for dropdowns, buttons, and UI elements
  - GSAP for message animations, typing effects, and floating elements
  - Mobile-responsive with phone mockup scaling appropriately
  - Keep existing background gradient and couple slider section

  The goal is to make users instantly understand how the AI saves them time by automating guest communication and address collection and answer any guest query they have for the wedding.
